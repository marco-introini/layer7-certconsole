# Layer7 API Gateway Certificate Manager

This Laravel 11 project is designed to manage certificates from multiple Layer7 API Gateways. It fetches private keys, trusted certificates, and user certificates, stores them in a database, and provides a clean and user-friendly interface for viewing and managing them.

---

## Features

- Fetch certificates from various Layer7 API Gateways.
- Store private keys, trusted certificates, and user certificates in a database.
- Display certificates in a clean and user-friendly interface.
- Console commands for importing data.
- Flexible and extensible architecture.

The main page is basically a Filament Table with all the information of certificates imported

![Main Project Page](./docs/01_mainpage.png)

You can filter for Certificare Type (User, Trusted, or Private Key), by Gateway or with free text search.

>Note that only the public part of your private keys are imported!

You can also show only valid (i.e., unexpired) certificates or only expired ones
